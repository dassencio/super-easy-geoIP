# Description

Easy-geoip is an easy-to-install and easy-to-use IP geolocation engine (written
in Python 3). It can be used either as server or as a stand-alone command-line
tool. If you want to get an IP geolocation server running in a matter of seconds,
you are at the right place!

**NOTE**: Since 01/01/2020, easy-geoip requires a license key from MaxMind to
work because MaxMind no longer provides IP geolocation databases publicly due to
privacy regulations. Please
[create an account](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup) on their website
and generate a license key before following the installation steps below.

# License

All code from this project is licensed under the GPLv3. See the
[`LICENSE`](https://github.com/dassencio/easy-geoip/tree/master/LICENSE) file
for more information.

# Installation instructions

Installing easy-geoip is super easy. You can either do the steps below directly
on the server on which easy-geoip will be hosted or locally on your machine.
The instructions below assume you are taking the first approach, but if you
wish to work locally, just copy all the files to the server at the end.

First, create and enter the directory where easy-geoip must be placed, then
clone this repository with the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/dassencio/easy-geoip.git .

The only thing left to do is generating the IP geolocation database. For that,
simply run the following command:

    ./generate-db <maxmind-license-key>

This script will automatically download, extract and segment the GeoLite2 city
database from MaxMind. Running this script again will remove the currently
existing database and generate a fresh one; I recommend you do this at least
once every month (or every few months) to make sure the geolocation data remains
accurate as it changes over time.

If you use Apache as a web server, easy-geoip should already be working.
Try opening the root page where you are hosting easy-geoip (e.g.
`http://mygeoip.org`); if everything is working, you will see the
geolocation data for you own IP address. This is the type of output you
should see:

    {
      "city": "Unknown",
      "continent": {
        "code": "NA",
        "name": "North America"
      },
      "country": {
        "code": "US",
        "name": "United States"
      },
      "ip_address": "8.8.8.8",
      "is_in_european_union": "0",
      "locale_code": "en",
      "metro_code": "Unknown",
      "subdivision1": {
        "code": "Unknown",
        "name": "Unknown"
      },
      "subdivision2": {
        "code": "Unknown",
        "name": "Unknown"
      },
      "time_zone": "Unknown"
    }

To select an IP address other than yours, specify it directly on the
URL through a query string using the format `http://mygeoip.org/?q=<IP>`.
For example, to get the geolocation data for IP `1.2.3.4`, open this URL:

    http://mygeoip.org/?q=1.2.3.4

By default, easy-geoip yields JSON output. If you wish to get output in
plain text format, specify it directly on the URL as in the example below:

    http://mygeoip.org/?q=1.2.3.4&format=plain

# Using easy-geoip as a stand-alone command-line tool

You don't need to use easy-geoip as a server. After you generate the database,
you can get IP geolocation data directly on your terminal. For that, run
the `easy-geoip` script as in the example below:

    ./easy-geoip -i 8.8.8.8

You can specify the output format too. For instance, to output plain text
instead of JSON, run:

    ./easy-geoip -f plain -i 8.8.8.8
